# FEL
-----
Flag Event Language or FEL is a simple scripting language inspired by Cave Story's [TSC Language](http://www.cavestory.org/guides/basicmodding/guide/tsc.html) but aims to deliver a more customizable, flexible and easier scripting language.  

FEL is meant to be used in conjunction with C++. FEL is a simple and has minimalistic control flow.  
For this reason I mostly refer to FEL as an "event language" instead of a scripting language.
