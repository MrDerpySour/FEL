# Structure
-----

### 1. Event ID

First of all, let's talk about how FEL is structured.  
An event is located on a single line.  

First of all, enter the ID of the event.  
The ID of the event is an int32 meaning that the ID can be anywhere from â€“2.147.483.648 to 2.147.483.647  
The only ID that can't be set is `-1`, this ID is reserved for error-checking.

For this example, let's use 1 as ID

Event so far:
```
1
```

### 2. Start marker

Next is the start marker.  
After your ID, put a `>`.  

Event so far:
```
1>
```

### 3. Syntax & Parameters

Next you can enter your [syntax](syntax.html).  
In this case, we'll be making a Hello World script.  

Looking at the syntax list we can see that `PRI` is the syntax for printing to the console.  
It takes 1 parameter: the message to print.  

To pass in parameters, you open a parameter block with the square brackets `[ ]`.  
Even if a command takes no parameters, you still open a parameter block.  
Since we're making a Hello world script, we'll pass in "Hello, world!" as the syntax.

  NOTE: Escape codes line `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\b`, `\v`, `\f`, `\a` and `\0` will work.

Event so far:
```
1>PRI[Hello, world!\n]
```

### 4. End marker

To end an event, append a `|`.

Event so far:
```
1>PRI[Hello, world!\n]|
```
This is a valid event and will be executed correctly.

### 5. Adding more syntax

So let's rewind to step 3 for a second.  
If you want to chain multiple commands together, we use a `-`.  

Let's say we're using a Windows system and we want to `pause` (although using the system function is bad practice).  
We can use the `SYS` command like so:

Event so far:
```
1>PRI[Hello, world!\n]-SYS[pause]
```

And now we add the `|` to end the event.  
```
1>PRI[Hello, world!\n]-SYS[pause]|
```

### Structure Philosophy

The structuring actually has some "philosophy" behind it.  
The idea was that it resembled a pipeline with the `>` being the beginning, the `-` being the pipe and the `|` being the stop.
